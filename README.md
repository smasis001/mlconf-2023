### Additional Instructions

If you plan to run workshops code in your **local machine**, make sure you have a working Jupyter environment with the latest version of Python. If you donâ€™t have one, you can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), but please do so before the session. The code we will using is located here:

- **Part 2a**: [colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s6J5YLRjpKxLAMdvJmE31LdOym44AkgJ/view?usp=sharing), [repo](https://github.com/smasis001/mlconf-2023/tree/main/notebooks/part2a_error_analysis_diabetes)

Although additional libraries can be installed quickly and usually do so without any issues, it is recommended that you install them in advance (just in case the local environment presents some problems).
